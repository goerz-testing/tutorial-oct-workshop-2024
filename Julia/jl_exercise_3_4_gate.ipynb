That is, for each time step, the time evolution operator is simply $\\exp(-i \\Op{H}_n dt)$ with a constant $\\Op{H}_n$ for the time step $dt$. For very small systems, one can evaluate the time evolution operator with direct matrix exponentiation (`QuantumPropagators.ExpProp`, as we have used in previous examples).

The two qubits can exchange excitations with the cavity. In the so-called dispersive limit the coupling $g$ between each qubit and the cavity is weak, such that the cavity only has \"virtual excitations\" which can be eliminated to obtain a simpler \"effective\" model containing only transmon levels. In this effective model, the two qubits have an always-on coupling $J$, i.e., they exchange excitations via the cavity at a certain rate. In addition, the microwave driving field in the transmission line drives the transitions between the transmon levels with an effective coupling $g^\\text{eff}$. Since we want to obtain a proper qubit, the population should only be in the two lowest levels $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ - the so-called logical levels. However, during gate operation, population may leak into higher levels of each transmon, depending on the strength of the driving field and the magnitude of the anharmonicity. This is not an issue as long as the population returns to the logical subspace at the end of the gate operation. Else the population in higher levels would need to be considered as \"lost\", reducing the gate fidelity. Numerically, we can truncated the transmon to keep the numerical effort manageable. For example, if we can verify that the control field only populates level $\\ket{0}$ – $\\ket{4}$ at any time it is appropriate to only consider $N = 6$ levels in our model."
